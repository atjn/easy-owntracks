## Note: the container by default expects to find this file at /config/configuration.yml.

## The theme to display: light, dark, grey, auto.
theme: auto

## Default redirection URL
##
## If user tries to authenticate without any referer, Authelia does not know where to redirect the user to at the end
## of the authentication process. This parameter allows you to specify the default redirection URL Authelia will use
## in such a case.
##
## Note: this parameter is optional. If not provided, user won't be redirected upon successful authentication.
### This is auto-generated
# default_redirection_url: https://home.example.com/

## Set the default 2FA method for new users and for when a user has a preferred method configured that has been
## disabled. This setting must be a method that is enabled.
## Options are totp, webauthn, mobile_push.

  ## The TOTP algorithm to use.
  ## It is CRITICAL you read the documentation before changing this option:
  ## https://www.authelia.com/c/totp#algorithm
  algorithm: sha1

  ## The number of digits a user has to input. Must either be 6 or 8.
  ## Changing this option only affects newly generated TOTP configurations.
  ## It is CRITICAL you read the documentation before changing this option:
  ## https://www.authelia.com/c/totp#digits
  digits: 6

  ## The period in seconds a one-time password is valid for.
  ## Changing this option only affects newly generated TOTP configurations.
  period: 30

  ## The skew controls number of one-time passwords either side of the current one that are valid.
  ## Warning: before changing skew read the docs link below.
  skew: 1
  ## See: https://www.authelia.com/c/totp#input-validation to read
  ## the documentation.

  ## The size of the generated shared secrets. Default is 32 and is sufficient in most use cases, minimum is 20.
  secret_size: 32

##

##
## NTP Configuration
##
## This is used to validate the servers time is accurate enough to validate TOTP.
ntp:
  ## NTP server address.
  address: "time.cloudflare.com:123"

  ## NTP version.
  version: 4

  ## Maximum allowed time offset between the host and the NTP server.
  max_desync: 3s

  ## Disables the NTP check on startup entirely. This means Authelia will not contact a remote service at all if you
  ## set this to true, and can operate in a truly offline mode.
  disable_startup_check: false

  ## The default of false will prevent startup only if we can contact the NTP server and the time is out of sync with
  ## the NTP server more than the configured max_desync. If you set this to true, an error will be logged but startup
  ## will continue regardless of results.
  disable_failure: true

##
## Authentication Backend Provider Configuration
##
## Used for verifying user passwords and retrieve information such as email address and groups users belong to.
##
## The available providers are: `file`, `ldap`. You must use only one of these providers.
authentication_backend:

  ## Password Reset Options.
  password_reset:
    ## Disable both the HTML element and the API for reset password functionality.
    disable: true

    ## External reset password url that redirects the user to an external reset portal. This disables the internal reset
    ## functionality.
    custom_url: ""

  ## The amount of time to wait before we refresh data from the authentication backend. Uses duration notation.
  ## To disable this feature set it to 'disable', this will slightly reduce security because for Authelia, users will
  ## always belong to groups they belonged to at the time of login even if they have been removed from them in LDAP.
  ## To force update on every request you can set this to '0' or 'always', this will increase processor demand.
  ## See the below documentation for more information.
  ## Duration Notation docs:  https://www.authelia.com/c/common#duration-notation-format
  ## Refresh Interval docs: https://www.authelia.com/c/1fa#refresh-interval
  refresh_interval: 5m

  ##
  ## File (Authentication Provider)
  ##
  ## With this backend, the users database is stored in a file which is updated when users reset their passwords.
  ## Therefore, this backend is meant to be used in a dev environment and not in production since it prevents Authelia
  ## to be scaled to more than one instance. The options under 'password' have sane defaults, and as it has security
  ## implications it is highly recommended you leave the default values. Before considering changing these settings
  ## please read the docs page below:
  ## https://www.authelia.com/r/passwords#tuning
  ##
  ## Important: Kubernetes (or HA) users must read https://www.authelia.com/t/statelessness
  ##
  file:
    path: /configs/authelia-users.yml
    password:
      algorithm: argon2id
      iterations: 1
      key_length: 32
      salt_length: 16
      memory: 1024
      parallelism: 8

##
## Password Policy Configuration.
##
password_policy:

  ## The standard policy allows you to tune individual settings manually.
  standard:
    enabled: false

    ## Require a minimum length for passwords.
    min_length: 8

    ## Require a maximum length for passwords.
    max_length: 0

    ## Require uppercase characters.
    require_uppercase: true

    ## Require lowercase characters.
    require_lowercase: true

    ## Require numeric characters.
    require_number: true

    ## Require special characters.
    require_special: true

  ## zxcvbn is a well known and used password strength algorithm. It does not have tunable settings.
  zxcvbn:
    enabled: true

    ## Configures the minimum score allowed.
    min_score: 3

##
## Access Control Configuration
##
## Access control is a list of rules defining the authorizations applied for one resource to users or group of users.
##
## If 'access_control' is not defined, ACL rules are disabled and the 'bypass' rule is applied, i.e., access is allowed
## to anyone. Otherwise restrictions follow the rules defined.
##
## Note: One can use the wildcard * to match any subdomain.
## It must stand at the beginning of the pattern. (example: *.mydomain.com)
##
## Note: You must put patterns containing wildcards between simple quotes for the YAML to be syntactically correct.
##
## Definition: A 'rule' is an object with the following keys: 'domain', 'subject', 'policy' and 'resources'.
##
## - 'domain' defines which domain or set of domains the rule applies to.
##
## - 'subject' defines the subject to apply authorizations to. This parameter is optional and matching any user if not
##    provided. If provided, the parameter represents either a user or a group. It should be of the form
##    'user:<username>' or 'group:<groupname>'.
##
## - 'policy' is the policy to apply to resources. It must be either 'bypass', 'one_factor', 'two_factor' or 'deny'.
##
## - 'resources' is a list of regular expressions that matches a set of resources to apply the policy to. This parameter
##   is optional and matches any resource if not provided.
##
## Note: the order of the rules is important. The first policy matching (domain, resource, subject) applies.
access_control:
  ## Default policy can either be 'bypass', 'one_factor', 'two_factor' or 'deny'. It is the policy applied to any
  ## resource if there is no policy to be applied to the user.
  default_policy: one_factor

  networks:
    - name: internal
      networks:
        - 10.10.0.0/16
        - 192.168.2.0/24
        - 172.0.0.0/8

  # rules:
  #   ## Rules applied to 'admins' group
  #   - domain: 'mx2.mail.example.com'
  #     subject: 'group:administrators'
  #     policy: deny

##
## Session Provider Configuration
##
## The session cookies identify the user once logged in.
## The available providers are: `memory`, `redis`. Memory is the provider unless redis is defined.
session:
  ## The name of the session cookie.
  name: owntracks_session

  ## The domain to protect.
  ## Note: the authenticator must also be in that domain.
  ## If empty, the cookie is restricted to the subdomain of the issuer.
  # This is auto-inserted on boot
  domain: INSERT SITE_ADDRESS

  ## Sets the Cookie SameSite value. Possible options are none, lax, or strict.
  ## Please read https://www.authelia.com/c/session#same_site
  same_site: lax

  ## The value for expiration, inactivity, and remember_me_duration are in seconds or the duration notation format.
  ## See: https://www.authelia.com/c/common#duration-notation-format
  ## All three of these values affect the cookie/session validity period. Longer periods are considered less secure
  ## because a stolen cookie will last longer giving attackers more time to spy or attack.

  ## The time before the cookie expires and the session is destroyed if remember me IS NOT selected.
  expiration: 1h

  ## The inactivity time before the session is reset. If expiration is set to 1h, and this is set to 5m, if the user
  ## does not select the remember me option their session will get destroyed after 1h, or after 5m since the last time
  ## Authelia detected user activity.
  inactivity: 5m

  ## The time before the cookie expires and the session is destroyed if remember me IS selected.
  ## Value of -1 disables remember me.
  remember_me_duration: 1M

##
## Regulation Configuration
##
## This mechanism prevents attackers from brute forcing the first factor. It bans the user if too many attempts are made
## in a short period of time.
regulation:
  ## The number of failed login attempts before user is banned. Set it to 0 to disable regulation.
  max_retries: 3

  ## The time range during which the user can attempt login before being banned. The user is banned if the
  ## authentication failed 'max_retries' times in a 'find_time' seconds window. Find Time accepts duration notation.
  ## See: https://www.authelia.com/c/common#duration-notation-format
  find_time: 2m

  ## The length of time before a banned user can login again. Ban Time accepts duration notation.
  ## See: https://www.authelia.com/c/common#duration-notation-format
  ban_time: 5m

##
## Storage Provider Configuration
##
## The available providers are: `local`, `mysql`, `postgres`. You must use one and only one of these providers.
storage:
  ##
  ## Local (Storage Provider)
  ##
  ## This stores the data in a SQLite3 Database.
  ## This is only recommended for lightweight non-stateful installations.
  ##
  ## Important: Kubernetes (or HA) users must read https://www.authelia.com/t/statelessness
  ##
  local:
    path: /owntracks-storage/authelia-store/database.sqlite3


##
## Notification Provider
##
## Notifications are sent to users when they require a password reset, a Webauthn registration or a TOTP registration.
## The available providers are: filesystem, smtp. You must use only one of these providers.
notifier:
  ## You can disable the notifier startup check by setting this to true.
  disable_startup_check: false

  ##
  ## File System (Notification Provider)
  ##
  ## Important: Kubernetes (or HA) users must read https://www.authelia.com/t/statelessness
  ##
  filesystem:
    filename: /owntracks-storage/authelia-store/notifications.txt
